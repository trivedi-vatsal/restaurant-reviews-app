Udacity FEND Restaurant Reviews
===============================
## Introduction
This is a project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.
The objective of the project is to take an app that is not working very well and make it fully responsive and accessible to users for all type of devices.
App should also be able to work when network connection is down or poor.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
### How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer:

`$ git clone https://github.com/vattytrivedi/restaurant-reviews-app.GIT`

and follow the instructions below:

* In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* In a terminal (like Git Bash, Cygwin or the Windows terminal), check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. You can now see the live site.


### Dependencies

The starter code for this project is based on the Udacity repository
(https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
